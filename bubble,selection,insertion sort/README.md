###### Code Description
*****************
The first program I made involving bubble, selection and insertion short. This code organizes the data in "jeans1.data" and "jeans2.data" using bubble/selection/insertion sort and dynamic memory.


###### Compile Walkthrough
****************
I made a makefile in order to be able to compile the code with ease, open up the compiler and go to the file directory, then type "make all" and "./test" afterwards in order to compile the code with ease.
